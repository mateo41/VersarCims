<b>Problem Description:</b>
<br />
<br />
Evaluating trends in the overlying water quality (temperature, salinity, 
dissolved oxygen) is necessary to understanding the variability in 
Chesapeake Bay benthic communities.  Unfortunately, at times, water 
quality data was not always recorded during benthic sampling.  Using 
other datasets, like the water quality monitoring data collected by the 
Chesapeake Bay Program (found in the CBP CIMS database), may be helpful 
in understanding environmental changes that shape benthic communities.  
The spatial and temporal sampling frequency of Versar Benthic data and 
its limited associated water quality, however, are different than the 
water quality monitoring data collected by the Chesapeake Bay Program. 
Our goal with this application is to provide an interface were 
scientists could regress bottom dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature and 
salinity data associated with the Versar benthic database to water 
quality data from the closest CBP CIMS station.  This will allow 
scientists evaluate whether it is reasonable to use CBP CIMS data in 
supplement or in the place of missing bottom measurements of water 
quality parameters.
