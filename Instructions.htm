<b>Steps:</b>
<br />
<br />
1. Use map to select a region of the Bay to evaluate data. <br />
2. Select a variable (dissolved oxygen, temperature or salinity). <br />
3. Enter the distance in space between CIMS and Versar stations to be 
evaluated (e.g. 1000 meter distance between stations selected for 
regression) <br />
4. Enter the distance in time (number of days) between sampling dates to 
be evaluated. (e.g. sampling dates with in 15 days of each other) <br />
5. Select "Make Plot" <br />
<br />
<b>Sample Output: </b>
 <br />
<br />
1. A Scatter plot of the selected variable data in Versar and CIMS datasets <br />
2. A correlation coefficient for the selected data. <br />
3. The data from which the scatterplot was generated from and the correlation coefficient
was calculated. The data includes ancillary attributes, dates, latitude, longitude, etc ... <br />
